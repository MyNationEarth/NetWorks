PVC Pipe Supply and Installation including open trench or boring techniques shall include all costs associated with the supply and installation of NBN Co approved PVC pipe and all associated components, including entry into pits/bore linkups, in all areas in accordance with the requirements of the relevant specifications.
The prices shall include excavation by all methods, bedding, supply, lay and joint pipe and fittings, backfill, compaction, roping and proving of pipe, localised temporary pavement reinstatement or topsoil and seeding as appropriate to match existing, day to day traffic control, disposal of spoil, waste (including slurry from boring operations), any other surplus materials and mobilisation and demobilisation of all necessary plant and equipment.
Pipe length for payment purposes will be measured the pit wall to pit wall between pits/manholes, from pit wall to base of a pole; and from pit wall to the point of contact on a building. All trenching codes are deemed to include the supply and installation of detectable marker tape. These prices shall also apply to paved areas where existing pavement breakout and reinstatement are paid using Schedule of Rates items CW‐06.
Dewatering, pumping and disposal of slurry or wet waste to be treated in accordance with all relevant local, state, territory and federal environmental laws. Any drilling at depths greater than 1.2m requires prior approval of the Datateks Disposal and Testing of Bore Mud:
Included in the schedule rate payment is for the subcontractor to dispose of waste drilling mud at a licensed EPA facility and provide receipts for this disposal to Datateks, any additional testing costs that the facility may add are the responsibility of the subcontractor. Should there be no licensed EPA facility available and the waste is taken to a non‐licenced facility the waste will need to be managed as per Drilling Mud Management Plan, any costs associated with the testing of the waste will be at the subcontractor’s expense.
